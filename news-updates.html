            Almost every story about the Indian auto industry will tell you it
            is a key market for automobile manufacturers, one that is growing
            quickly. Only in recent years, the market has started shifting
            towards electrified vehicles and a focus on localised production of
            the most expensive aspect: batteries. One of the biggest
            developments in that regard has been the recent discovery of lithium
            reserves in Jammu & Kashmir, an estimated 5.9 million tonnes of it!

            Lithium is an essential material used in the making of batteries for
            electric vehicles. Most EVs in the world use lithium-ion batteries.
            But what exactly does a reserve of unharvested lithium mean for the
            Indian auto and energy industry? Here are five things that could
            happen if we use this reserve carefully:
